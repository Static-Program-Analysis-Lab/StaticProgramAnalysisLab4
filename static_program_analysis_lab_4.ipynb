    "# &#128221; Exercise 1: Simple Data Flow Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## &#127919; Objective\n",
    "In this exercise, we will delve into a fundamental aspect of program analysis known as Data Flow Analysis. \n",
    "This technique is important for understanding how data moves and transforms across a program. \n",
    "We will use a well-known analysis known as the Reaching Definition Analysis to illustrate the concepts of data flow analysis. \n",
    "This will provide a foundation for understanding how different definitions of a variable can reach various points in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## &#128214; Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Flow Analysis is a method used to gather valuable information about a program's execution. \n",
    "It examines the transformations and movement of data across the program, focusing on how the data values change and interact over the program's control flow graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reaching Definition Analysis is a specific form of data flow analysis that aims to determine at each point in the program, the set of variable definitions that may have reached that point. \n",
    "It's a forward analysis that propagates definition information from the start to the end of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key terms associated with this analysis:\n",
    "- **Definition:** A statement where a variable is assigned a new value.\n",
    "- **Reaching Definition:** A definition that can reach a particular point in the program without any re-definition of the variable.\n",
    "- **Gen Set:** The set of definitions generated by a statement.\n",
    "- **Kill Set:** The set of definitions killed (or invalidated) by a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#128161; Gen and Kill Sets in Dataflow Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In dataflow analysis, \"gen\" and \"kill\" sets are fundamental concepts used to model how information flows through a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gen Set**: Represents the information *generated* at a particular program point. It contains facts that are true after the program statement is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kill Set**: Represents the information *invalidated* or *killed* at that program point. It contains facts that are no longer true after the statement is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gen and kill sets help in computing \"in\" and \"out\" sets for each program point, providing a basis for various optimizations and analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#128161; In and Out Sets in Dataflow Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to gen and kill sets, \"in\" and \"out\" sets are crucial for understanding how data flows through a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In Set**: Represents the set of *facts* that hold true just before a particular program point is reached. It is computed based on the out sets of the program points that immediately precede it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Out Set**: Represents the set of *facts* that hold true just after the program point is executed. It is computed as a function of the in set and the gen and kill sets at that program point. The formula for computing the out set is generally:  \n",
    "  `Out = Gen U (In - Kill)`\n",
    "\n",
    "&#10145; The computation of the `Out` set in this case is a function of the `In`, `Gen`, and `Kill` sets.\n",
    "This function is called a **Flow Function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of data flow analysis, a **flow function** is a mathematical abstraction that models the effect of a program statement or a basic block on the data flow information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The flow function `f` is generally defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`f(In) = Gen U (In - Kill)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific nature of these sets and the flow function itself will vary depending on the type of data flow analysis being conducted, such as reaching definitions, live variables, or available expressions analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The in and out sets are calculated iteratively until they reach a fixed point, which enables various static analyses and optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#128161; Fact in Dataflow Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of dataflow analysis, a \"fact\" is a piece of information that holds true at a specific point in a program (e.g., a fact could be: *this variable is null at this program point*, or: *this variable equals exactly 10 at this program point*).\n",
    "Facts can represent various properties such as the availability of an expression, reaching definitions, or the possible values a variable can take. \n",
    "They are the building blocks used in gen and kill sets to propagate information through the program, facilitating various types of static analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reaching Definition Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Reaching Definition Analysis is a fundamental data flow analysis that provides a basis for many optimization and analysis techniques in compiler design and program analysis. \n",
    "Its primary utility lies in determining what definitions of variables may be used at various points in a program, which can, in turn, help in various optimizations and analyses such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dead Code Elimination:** By identifying definitions that don't reach any use, we can identify and eliminate dead code.\n",
    "2. **Constant Propagation:** By tracking the definitions that reach each point, we can propagate constants and simplify expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10          # Definition D1\n",
    "y = 20          # Definition D2\n",
    "x = 30          # Definition D3\n",
    "z = x + y       # Use U1 of x and y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially, `x` is defined as `10` (Definition D1) and `y` is defined as `20` (Definition D2).\n",
    "- Then `x` is re-defined as `30` (Definition D3), overriding the previous definition D1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's analyze the reaching definitions at different points in this program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before the statement `x = 30`:\n",
    "   - The set of reaching definitions is `{D1, D2}`.\n",
    "2. Before the statement `z = x + y`:\n",
    "   - The set of reaching definitions is `{D2, D3}` as `D3` has overridden `D1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the use `U1` of `x` and `y` in the expression `x + y`, the reaching definitions for `x` and `y` are `D3` and `D2` respectively. Definition `D1` for `x` is no longer reaching this point as it has been overridden by `D3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates why the set of reaching definitions changes as we progress through the code, and how the latest definition of a variable at any point in the code is the one that reaches that point, provided no other definitions of the same variable occur in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## &#10145; Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Reaching Definition Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Familiarize yourself with the concept of reaching definitions and how it is used in data flow analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implementing Reaching Definition Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Use the `ControlFlowGraph` class to support the computation of reaching definitions.\n",
    "   - Implement a worklist algorithm to compute the in-sets and out-sets of definitions for each node in the CFG.\n",
    "   - Verify your implementation with simple examples to see the reaching definitions at each point in the program."
